### Resources 

Here are some resources you can use to learn the tech stack of Contest Countdown

#### Javascript 
This is a javascript project. Basic knowledge of javascript is a must for reading and writing code in this project.

If you are not familiar with javascript, then I would suggest:

- [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/): A very concise book that I personally learned from and recommend.
- YouTube Lectures from channels like [ CodeWithHarry ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeVMnSShP_Iviwkknt83cww) (Hindi) or [ Programming with Mosh ](https://www.youtube.com/user/programmingwithmosh) (English).

#### Chrome API
Chrome extensions use the chrome API to communicate with the browser. If you want to contribute in the chrome extension side of this repository then you could learn chrome API from-

- [Chrome's official Guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/)


#### Gnome Javascript

If you want to work on the gnome extension then these resources will come in handy- (These resources are also helpful in developing gnome applications) 

- [ Tutorial ](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5271677/How-to-Create-A-GNOME-Extension) for Gnome extensions. This will give you a basic overview of how extensions work, it is however not necessary to read this as the extension will already be structured.

- [Gjs Documentation](https://gjs-docs.gnome.org/) very useful for looking up any unknown function you encounter while working on this project.

- Moreover, the best way of learning to code is through example. Look up the Github repositories of other gnome plugins and steal their tricks!
